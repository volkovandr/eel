# Extremely verbose extremely expressive language
Created just for fun

# Motivation
The idea is to let developers express what they want to do with the means of the language in a way
that is understandable by humans, not only by computers. We believe the code must be expressive enough
that one would not need any comments or documentation. 

# Syntax
[Please refer here](/doc/syntax.md)

# TODO
Create a translator to Python for functions and simple scripting
