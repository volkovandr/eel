# Expressive language (Eel)
Created just for fun

# Motivation
The idea is to let developers express what they want to do with the means of the language in a way
that is understandable by humans, not only by computers. We believe the code must be expressive enough
that one would not need any comments or documentation. 

# Syntax
[Please refer here](/doc/syntax.md)

# Testing

To run unit tests for the python code change directory to src/main/py and execute

```
python3 -m unittest discover -s ../../test/py
```
