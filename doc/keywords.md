# Keywords
The keywords have special meaning. Although you can name your functions and variables using those words, that is not recommended. Because in case of confusion the interpreter will treat them as keywords.

Combinations of keywords can work differently as the separated keywords. For example `the` in the function definition and `the` in `do the following` have different meaning.
